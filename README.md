# RecipeBook
First android app I've made. App to store your favorite recipes.
The idea behind the app is to help me and my girlfriend shop for our recipes.
Most of them are in our heads so it's easy to forget one or two ingredients in the recipe but with the help of this app
that shouldn't be a problem anymore!

#### Functionality

1. The user can store recipe information such as name, and name and amount of each ingredient.
The app saves each recipe so they remain when you close the app or update it.

2. The user can edit existing recipes, add ingredients, remove them etc.

3. The user view each recipe and click checkboxes on each ingredient while shopping to make sure they get everything.

4. The user can send their favorite recipes to their friends! Works behind the scenes using a firebase database.

#### Download

Only works for android!
You can download the APK for the app by [clicking here](https://github.com/AxlLind/RecipeBook/raw/master/RecipeBook.apk).
Simply open the file and your device should take care of the rest.

The app has mostly been tested on smartphones, mainly the Samsung s6 and HTC One.
